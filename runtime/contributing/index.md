We welcome and appreciate all contributions to Deno.

This page serves as a helper to get you started on contributing.

## Projects

There are numerous repositories in the [`denoland`](https://github.com/denoland)
organization that are part of the Deno ecosystem.

Repositories have different scopes, use different programming languages and have
varying difficulty level when it comes to contributions.

To help you decide which repository might be the best to start contributing
(and/or falls into your interest), here's a short comparison (**codebases
primarily comprise the languages in bold**):

### [deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno)

This is the main repository that provides the `deno` CLI.

If you want to fix a bug or add a new feature to `deno` this is the repository
to contribute to.

Some systems, including a large part of the Node.js compatibility layer are
implemented in JavaScript and TypeScript modules. These are a good place to
start if you are looking to make your first contribution.

While iterating on such modules it is recommended to include `--features hmr` in
your `cargo` flags. This is a special development mode where the JS/TS sources
are not included in the binary but read at runtime, meaning the binary will not
have to be rebuilt if they are changed.

To use the commands below, you need to first install the necessary tools on your
system as described [here](building_from_source).

```sh
# cargo build
cargo build --features hmr

# cargo run -- run hello.ts
cargo run --features hmr -- run hello.ts

# cargo test integration::node_unit_tests::os_test
cargo test --features hmr integration::node_unit_tests::os_test
```

Also remember to reference this feature flag in your editor settings. For VSCode
users, combine the following into your workspace file:

```jsonc
{
  "settings": {
    "rust-analyzer.cargo.features": ["hmr"],
    // Adds support for resolving internal `ext:*` modules
    "deno.importMap": "tools/core_import_map.json"
  }
}
```

To use a development version of the LSP in VSCode:

1. Install and enable the
   [Deno VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno)
2. Update your VSCode settings and point `deno.path` to your development binary:

```jsonc
// .vscode/settings.json
{
  "deno.path": "/path/to/your/deno/target/debug/deno"
}
```

Languages: **Rust**, **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**

### [deno_std](https://github.com/denoland/deno_std)

The standard library for Deno.

Languages: **TypeScript**, WebAssembly

### [fresh](https://github.com/denoland/fresh)

The next-gen web framework.

Languages: **TypeScript**, TSX

### [deno_lint](https://github.com/denoland/deno_lint)

Linter that powers `deno lint` subcommand.

Languages: **Rust**

### [deno_doc](https://github.com/denoland/deno_doc)

Documentation generator that powers `deno doc` subcommand, and reference
documentation on https://docs.deno.com/api, and https://jsr.io.

Languages: **Rust**

### [rusty_v8](https://github.com/denoland/rusty_v8)

Rust bindings for the V8 JavaScript engine. Very technical and low-level.

Languages: **Rust**

### [serde_v8](https://github.com/denoland/deno_core/tree/main/serde_v8)

Library that provides bijection layer between V8 and Rust objects. Based on
[`serde`](https://crates.io/crates/serde) library. Very technical and low-level.

Languages: **Rust**

### [deno_docker](https://github.com/denoland/deno_docker)

Official Docker images for Deno.

## General remarks

- Read the [style guide](/runtime/contributing/style_guide).

- Please don't make [the benchmarks](https://deno.land/benchmarks) worse.

- Ask for help in the [community chat room](https://discord.gg/deno).

- If you are going to work on an issue, mention so in the issue's comments
  _before_ you start working on the issue.

- If you are going to work on a new feature, create an issue and discuss with
  other contributors _before_ you start working on the feature; we appreciate
  all contributions but not all proposed features will be accepted. We don't
  want you to spend hours working on code that might not be accepted.

- Please be professional in the forums. We follow
  [Rust's code of conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct)
  (CoC). Have a problem? Email [ry@tinyclouds.org](mailto:ry@tinyclouds.org).

## Submitting a pull request

Before submitting a PR to any of the repos, please make sure the following is
done:

1. Give the PR a descriptive title.

Examples of good PR title:

- fix(std/http): Fix race condition in server
- docs(console): Update docstrings
- feat(doc): Handle nested re-exports

Examples of bad PR title:

- fix #7123
- update docs
- fix bugs

2. Ensure there is a related issue and that it is referenced in the PR text.
3. Ensure there are tests that cover the changes.

## Submitting a PR to [`deno`](https://github.com/denoland/deno)

In addition to the above make sure that:

> To use the commands below, you need to first install the necessary tools on
> your system as described [here](building_from_source).

1. `cargo test` passes - this will run full test suite for `deno` including unit
   tests, integration tests and Web Platform Tests

1. Run `./tools/format.js` - this will format all of the code to adhere to the
   consistent style in the repository

1. Run `./tools/lint.js` - this will check Rust and JavaScript code for common
   mistakes and errors using `clippy` (for Rust) and `dlint` (for JavaScript)

## Submitting a PR to [`deno_std`](https://github.com/denoland/deno_std)

In addition to the above make sure that:

1. All of the code you wrote is in `TypeScript` (ie. don't use `JavaScript`)

1. `deno test --unstable --allow-all` passes - this will run full test suite for
   the standard library

1. Run `deno fmt` in the root of repository - this will format all of the code
   to adhere to the consistent style in the repository.

1. Run `deno lint` - this will check TypeScript code for common mistakes and
   errors.

## Submitting a PR to [`fresh`](https://github.com/denoland/fresh)

First, please be sure to
[install Puppeteer](https://github.com/lucacasonato/deno-puppeteer#installation).
Then, please ensure `deno task ok` is run and successfully passes.

## Documenting APIs

It is important to document all public APIs and we want to do that inline with
the code. This helps ensure that code and documentation are tightly coupled
together.

### JavaScript and TypeScript

All publicly exposed APIs and types, both via the `deno` module as well as the
global/`window` namespace should have JSDoc documentation. This documentation is
parsed and available to the TypeScript compiler, and therefore easy to provide
further downstream. JSDoc blocks come just prior to the statement they apply to
and are denoted by a leading `/**` before terminating with a `*/`. For example:

```ts
/** A simple JSDoc comment */
export const FOO = "foo";
```

### Rust

Use
[this guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/how-to-write-documentation.html)
for writing documentation comments in Rust code.
